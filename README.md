# Horoskopos
## Concept

Hōroskopos is the project for a virtual astrological planetarium. It is a learning environment, which simulates the real sky and allows users to visualize astrological concepts and symbols. Observing the movements of the Sun, Moon and planets throughout the days and seasons can give you an insight on how they gained cultural, philosophical and spiritual significance.

## Development

This project is being developed in Unity3D with the help of SwissEphNet, a C# port of the Swiss Ephemeris code library. 

## Team

César Daher - Development, interface design

Pedro Joffily - Visual identity
