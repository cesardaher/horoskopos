    name: Sun
    description: The Sun is the leader, the center, the ruler of the day. Hot and
      dry, he emits a warm golden glow. When above the horizon, his light brings
      in the day. However, when he falls beneath it, he goes to sleep and lets the
      other stars illuminate instead. He rules the middle of Summer and is weakened
      mid-Winter. He represents centrality, leadership, spirit, the drive and the
      intentions and the heart.
  - id: 1
    name: Moon
    description: "The Moon is the body, the mind, the ruler of the night. Cold and
      wet, she emits a gentle silvery glow. She moves quickly through the sky, her
      light changing as she approaches and leaves the Sun\u2019s side. She takes
      over while the Sun is asleep, and allows us to rest under her caring embrace.
      She rules the start of Summer and is weakened in the beginning of Winter. She
      represents movement, shapeshifting, emotions, sensitivity, the breasts and
      the stomach."
  - id: 2
    name: Mercury
    description: "Mercury is intellect, language, the messenger. They are cold and
      dry, their light ever-changing. They are unpredictable and hard to find, moving
      backwards almost as often as forward. They are the closest to the Sun and are
      always within its reach. You can sometimes find them at dawn and dusk, but
      don\u2019t expect it to be easy. They rule the end of Spring and Summer but
      don\u2019t function well at the end of Autumn and Winter. They represent thoughts,
      reason, numbers, codes, the tongue and the bowels."
  - id: 3
    name: Venus
    description: "Venus is love, pleasure, beauty. She is warm and wet, her white
      light shining the brightest. She can be found at either sunrise or sundown
      among the gentle colors of the twilight. When she appears, her presence is
      unmistakable, but she won\u2019t stay for long. She rules the middle of Spring
      and start of Autumn, and is weak mid-Autumn and at the beginning of Spring.
      She represents connection, friendship, desire, arts, the neck and the back."
  - id: 4
    name: Mars
    description: Mars is strength, aggression and power. Hot and dry, his light is
      scorching red. He is slower than the Sun and the first to reach independence,
      wandering through the sky at his own will. He is more functional when the Sun
      is down, for his hot temper is cooled by the night. He rules the beginning
      of Spring and middle of Autumn and is weakened by the coming of Autumn and
      mid-Spring. He represents separation, violence, conflict, resistance, the head
      and the blood.
  - id: 5
    name: Jupiter
    description: "Jupiter is luck, freedom and order. Warm and wet, he emits a gentle
      yellow glow. He moves as a pilgrim through the sky, exploring, connecting and
      growing. He prefers the day, when the ideas are given clarity. He rules the
      end of Autumn and Winter and is misunderstood at the end of Spring and Summer.
      He represents growth, prosperity, law, fertility, the thighs and the feet.\r"
  - id: 6
    name: Saturn
    description: Saturn is solitude, boundaries and death. Very cold and moderately
      dry, his light is a sullen brown. He is the oldest and darkest of all, the
      one that bows to no other star. He takes his time as he moves through the sky,
      slowing down time and demanding patience. He prefers the day, when the boundaries
      of the world are clear. He rules the first stages of Winter, when the Sun is
      the weakest, and dislikes the first stages of Summer, when the Sun is the strongest.
      He represents time, decay, patience, discipline, the bones and the knees.
  - id: 7
    name: Uranus
    description: Uranus is revolution and rebellion. An outer planet, it is invisible
      and exists outside the boundaries of human perception. It brings change wherever
      it goes, releasing the existing tensions in unpredictable and unexpected ways.
  - id: 8
    name: Saturn
    description: Neptune is dreaming and fantasy. An outer planet, it is invisible
      and exists outside the boundaries of human perception. It transcends the limits
      of reality into other realms of existence. It can bring enlightenment as much
      as it can bring delusions.
  - id: 9
    name: Pluto
    description: Pluto is destruction and rebirth. An outer planet, it is invisible
      and exists outside the boundaries of human perception. It crumbles down whatever
      has no more use in order to welcome the new.
